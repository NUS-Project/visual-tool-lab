He had one episode of vomiting. The patient also reports difficulty seeing out of his right eye, which he attributes to excessive tearing. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for hypertension. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 135/91 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 12/min. The patient\u2019s right eye is shown in Figure A. Upon physical examination, the right pupil is minimally responsive to light and the globe feels firm. A right-sided carotid bruit is appreciated. Which of the following is the most appropriate prophylaxis for this patient\u2019s condition? Options: (A) Acetazolamide (B) Amitriptyline (C) Clopidogrel (D) Epinephrine",

She was delivered preterm at 35 weeks, and her medical history is significant for several ear infections over the last year. Her older brother has been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but the rest of her family history is otherwise unremarkable. The patient has become more withdrawn lately and has sometimes been ignoring her parents when asked to perform tasks at home. This seems to have worsened over the last 8 weeks. Otherwise, the patient is energetic and started preschool 3 months ago. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 98/62 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 26/min. The patient successfully draws a square and can stand on 1 foot. Her language skills are unchanged from her appointment 6 months ago. Her neurological examination is normal, and she is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. She seems distracted during the interview and responds only intermittently to the physician\u2019s directions. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Options: (A) Audiometry testing (B) Autism spectrum screening questionnaire (C) Parent and teacher ADHD rating scales (D) Refer to genetic testing",

His temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 153/91 mmHg, pulse is 40/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Physical exam reveals a frail man who is unable to ambulate secondary to lightheadedness. His neurological exam is otherwise non-focal. An ECG is performed as seen in Figure A.
