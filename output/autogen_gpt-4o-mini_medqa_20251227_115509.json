        "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take? Options: (A) Disclose the error to the patient but leave it out of the operative report (B) Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report (C) Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake (D) Report the physician to the ethics committee (E) Refuse to dictate the operative report",

        "question": "Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg.

        "model_response": "To determine the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, we need to analyze the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and the renal biopsy results.\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: \n   - The patient is a 61-year-old man with decreased urinary output and malaise two weeks after cardiac catheterization.\n   - He has a fever (38\u00b0C), elevated leukocyte count (16,400/mm\u00b3), and mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet, which suggests possible vascular involvement.\n   - He has a history of type 2 diabetes and is on multiple medications, including aspirin and clopidogrel.\n\n2. **Laboratory Findings**:\n   - The patient has elevated serum creatinine (4.2 mg/dL) indicating renal impairment.\n   - The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is significantly elevated (68 mm/h), indicating inflammation.\n\n3. **Renal Biopsy Results**:\n   - The biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles, which can be indicative of cholesterol embolization.\n\n4. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Renal papillary necrosis**: Typically associated with analgesic use or diabetes, but does not explain the purplish discoloration or the biopsy findings.\n   - **Allergic interstitial nephritis**: Usually presents with eosinophilia and is often related to medications, but the biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis.\n   - **Cholesterol embolization**: This condition can occur after procedures like cardiac catheterization and is characterized by skin changes (like the mottled discoloration) and renal impairment. The presence of spindle-shaped vacuoles in the renal biopsy is consistent with this diagnosis.\n   - **Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis**: This condition typically presents with asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis, which does not fit the current presentation.\n   - **Polyarteritis nodosa**: This is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the kidneys but does not typically present with the specific biopsy findings noted.\n\nGiven the context of recent cardiac catheterization, the symptoms of renal impairment, skin changes, and the specific findings on renal biopsy, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is **cholesterol embolization**.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\nThe final answer is C\n```\nTERMINATE",
